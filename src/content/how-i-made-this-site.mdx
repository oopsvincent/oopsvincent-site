# How I made this Portfolio Site

Hey folks! 👋  
In this post, I’m taking you behind the scenes of how I built this portfolio/blog site using **Next.js**, **App Router**, and **MDX** — and how I almost lost my mind configuring `dark mode` (but we don't talk about that 😅).


## 🧠 The Stack

Here’s the tech I used:

- **Next.js 14** — App Router, server components, and layout nesting.
- **MDX** — For blog content because who doesn’t want Markdown + React?
- **Tailwind CSS** — For utility-first styling without breaking a sweat.
- **Framer Motion** — For spicy UI transitions.
- **Custom Dark/Light Theme** — With pure CSS variables.

---

## 🛠️ Project Setup

I kicked things off with:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest oopsvincent --ts --app
````

Enabled Tailwind with:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

And replaced the entire Tailwind config with **nothing**… because I’m managing all variables via `globals.css` (yes, I live on the edge).

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

I went with a clean structure to keep things modular:

```
/src
  /app
    /blog
      [slug]/page.tsx
      page.tsx
    layout.tsx
  /components
  /content
  /lib
  /types
```

All blog posts live in `/src/content`, written in `.mdx` files. I parse them using `gray-matter` and render them with `remark-html`.

---

## ✍️ Writing Blogs with MDX

Each blog post has frontmatter like this:

```mdx
---
title: "My First Blog"
slug: "my-first-blog"
summary: "I made a blog!"
date: "2025-06-18"
tags: ["blog", "nextjs"]
category: "Personal"
---
```

Then I use `gray-matter` to extract metadata and `remark` to turn Markdown into HTML. Easy-peasy.

## 🌗 Dark/Light Mode

My theme toggler is powered by **CSS variables** and localStorage. I avoided Tailwind’s `dark:` classes for cleaner control. I use:

```css
:root {
  --background: #fff;
  --foreground: #171717;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background: #0a0a0a;
    --foreground: #ededed;
  }
}
```

Then, JS toggles a `theme` class on `<html>`. Boom. No plugin hell.

## 🧩 Reusable Components

The site uses reusable components like:

* `Navbar` with mobile/desktop logic
* `ArticleListItem` to render posts by category
* `ThemeToggle` to switch themes without crying
* `BlogLayout` (coming soon 👀)

---

## ⚙️ Challenges

* The **dynamic route bug** (`params.slug must be awaited`) wasted 3 hours of my life. I survived by adding a useless `await` that mysteriously fixed it 🤡
* Moment.js complained about my date format. Solved by using `YYYY-MM-DD` in my frontmatter and never touching `moment().format()` before `.toISOString()` again.
* Balancing design consistency with Tailwind freedom… still an art.

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

* Add a search bar to filter blogs by title or tag
* Support image embeds and syntax highlighting
* Analytics (but only the non-creepy kind)
* Maybe RSS? Still debating like a French philosopher in a café.

## ❤️ Final Thoughts

This site is my digital home. A place to share stories, tech, and progress as I build toward my dreams. If you’re reading this — thanks. And if you’re building something too, I’m rooting for you. Hard.

Stay curious,
