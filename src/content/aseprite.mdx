# 🎨 Aseprite: The Pixel Artist’s Best Friend

If you’ve ever tried making pixel art, chances are you’ve heard whispers in the shadows… *"Use Aseprite!"*  
And guess what? They're right.

> “Aseprite is like MS Paint if it trained in a monastery for 10 years and came back as a pixel-art ninja.” — Me, probably.

## 🧵 Why Aseprite Is Loved by Pixel Artists

Aseprite is **dedicated to pixel art**, and that changes *everything*. Unlike Photoshop or GIMP, which try to do it all, Aseprite focuses on what matters:

- ✏️ **Pixel-precise drawing**
- 🌀 **Onion skinning** for animations
- 🧃 **Palette control** like a god-tier paintbox
- 🎞️ **Frame-by-frame animation tools**
- 💾 Export to `.png`, `.gif`, `.json` — all formats you’d dream of

## 🛠 Getting Started with Aseprite

Install it from [aseprite.org](https://www.aseprite.org/) — it’s paid but **worth every pixel**.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite.git
cd aseprite
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLAF_BACKEND=skia ..
ninja aseprite
